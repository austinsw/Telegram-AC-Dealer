# auto-dispatcher

Need to add threading to handle multiple users' event? Javascript?

#command:
1: For requesting a phone no. and sms: /request

2: For adding new user: /add {user_id} {num}

3: For listing all the user status: /list

4: For checking a specific user status: /user {user_id}

Only super users can use 2,3,4. Normal users can only use 1.

/help command and /start command also exist, fyi.
